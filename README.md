# Hi, I'm Minz ðŸ‘‹

I began my coding journey in 2018, starting with simple Discord bots for my servers and small scripts for our company. In 2025, I kicked off my first major project: an order application built on Python with NiceGUI, delivered as a progressive web app (PWA).  
Along the way, I fell in love with Docker, Portainer, Hetzner's cloud offerings, load balancing, and the Linux ecosystem.

Feel free to explore my work or reach out if you need help with anything!
